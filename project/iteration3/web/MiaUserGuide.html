    <h1>Loading and Annotating Images in MIA</h1>
    <p>One of the best features packaged in MIA is the ability for doctors to annotate medical images for analysis. This tutorial details how a doctor can annotate a photo using this software.</p>
    <h2>Loading Images</h2>
    <p>Upon launching the application, two windows will open. One will be labelled &ldquo;Medical Image Analysis (MIA)&rdquo; and the other will be labelled &ldquo;Controls&rdquo;. The Control panel handles loading of images.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The rightmost column of the Control panel handles image loading and saving.</li>
      <li>In the &ldquo;Image I/O&rdquo; section, navigate to the image that you wish to annotate.</li>
      <li>Double click the image to prepare it for loading.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If done successfully, a line of text will appear above the &ldquo;Load Canvas&rdquo; button that reads: &ldquo;Will Load: [Image name]&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Load Canvas&rdquo; button will no longer be grayed out.</li>
      </ul>
      <li >Click the &ldquo;Load Canvas&rdquo; button to load the image.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Annotating Images</h2>
    <p>There are many tools within the MIA application designed to help the doctor find areas of interest and annotate the image to draw attention to those areas. The Filters are designed to adjust the image to make it easier for the doctor to find the areas of interest, and the tools are designed to assist with annotation. There are two tools included in MIA: a red pen and an arrow. The red pen can be used to draw anywhere on the canvas, circle areas of interest, and draw over unimportant information. The Arrow is used to mark specific areas that are important. Choosing between the two tools is as easy as selected one of the radio buttons in the &ldquo;Tool Type&rdquo; section in the leftmost column of the Controls panel.</p>
