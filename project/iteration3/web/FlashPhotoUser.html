    <h1>Getting Started with FlashPhoto</h1>
    <p><em>Using brushes and filters to adjust an image</em></p>
    <p>FlashPhoto is a robust program, with many different tools that are available to you. This brief tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Load an image onto the canvas</li>
      <li>Use a brush to draw on the image</li>
      <li>Apply a filter to the image</li>
      <li>Save the image</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After completion of this tutorial, you will possess all of the knowledge to utilize the FlashPhoto application&rsquo;s features. Although we will not cover every brush or filter in this tutorial, the steps discussed will be the same for every other brush and filter.</p>
    <h2>Loading an Image onto the Canvas</h2>
    <p>Once you have successfully opened the application, it is time to load an image to the canvas. In the Controls panel, the rightmost section is labeled &ldquo;Image I/O&rdquo;. This is where you will load up your images.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using the file browser within the Image I/O, navigate to either a JPEG or PNG image that you want to edit.</li>
      <li>Double click on that image file name to select it.</li>
      <li>Above the &ldquo;Load Image&rdquo; button, you should see a line of text that reads &ldquo;Will load: [your image file name]&rdquo;. If this is not present, it means that you have either not selected the image file correctly, or the file is not a JPEG or PNG image file.</li>
      <li>Click the &ldquo;Load Image&rdquo; button.</li>
      <li>The canvas will change to selected image.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 >Use a Brush to Draw on the Image</h2>
    <p>You can draw on the image using any one of the brushes or tools that are included in the application. Inside the Controls panel, the leftmost column is used to select your tool and set its parameters. The &ldquo;Tool Type&rdquo; section can be used to select a tool. The &ldquo;Tool Color&rdquo; section can be used to change the color of the tool. By default, the Pen tool will be selected with Black as its color. To apply a tool to the canvas, simply press and click anywhere on the canvas and drag your cursor.</p>
    <h2>Apply a Filter to the Image</h2>
    <p>Applying a filter to the image is another simple task within the FlashPhoto application. The middle column of the Controls panel is labelled &ldquo;Filters&rdquo;. Nine different filters come stock within the FlashPhoto application. Some of these filters have parameters that set the intensity of the filter or other options. The best policy to become familiar with the filters is to test all of them out. If you don&rsquo;t like the outcome of an applied filter, you may always use the &ldquo;Undo/Redo&rdquo; buttons to revert to a version of the photo before the filter was applied.</p>
    <p>To apply the filter, simply set the parameters (if any) of the filter, and click the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; button contained within the box around the filter name and parameters. The image in the canvas will be updated per your filter specifications.</p>
    <h2>Saving the Image</h2>
    <p>After you have edited the photo using brushes and filters, you will most likely want to save the image. Saving the canvas is in the rightmost column of the Controls panel.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If you want to save the image with the same file name, simply click the &ldquo;Save Canvas&rdquo; button.</li>
      <li>If you want to save the image with a new file name, delete the image name from the &ldquo;Image:&rdquo; input area.</li>
      <li>Type your new file name. Make sure to append the filename with either &ldquo;.jpeg&rdquo; or &ldquo;.png&rdquo; otherwise the image will not save correctly!</li>
      <li>Click the &ldquo;Save Canvas&rdquo; button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After you have completed all of these steps, you possess the knowledge necessary to begin to explore the many features that FlashPhoto has to offer. Most importantly, have fun!</p>
